<p>The evolution of the internet is a remarkable journey that has transformed communication, information sharing, and commerce. It began in the late 1960s as ARPANET, a project initiated by the U.S. Department of Defense, aimed at connecting various research institutions. This network utilized packet-switching technology, allowing multiple computers to communicate efficiently. In the 1980s, the introduction of the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) standardized data transmission, paving the way for the modern internet. The launch of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee revolutionized how information was accessed and shared, enabling the creation of websites and web browsers. As technology advanced, high-speed broadband connections and wireless internet access emerged, making the internet more accessible to the masses. Social media platforms, e-commerce, and streaming services began to reshape how people interacted, conducted business, and consumed media. Today, the internet is an integral part of daily life, driving innovations in various fields and connecting billions of users worldwide, continually evolving with advancements in technology and changing user needs.</p>
